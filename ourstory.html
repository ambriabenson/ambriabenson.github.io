	<h2><b>Our Families Story</b> </h2>

	<h3>Our family moved from Florence, Italy in 1910. Alfredo Zanella and Pinguini Zanella came to America to escape poverty in Italy. They wanted to start a new life here in America, but did not know where to start. The one thing they missed most about Italy was the smell of fresh mozzarella and pasta. Alfredo was one of the premiere chefs in Italy and cooking was one of his passions. Alfredo and Pinguini got some of their friends to agree to help them open the first Zanella Restaurant in 1912 in Brooklyn, New York. It was not an instant hit, but after many years of hard work and learning English the Zanellas finally got the recognition they deserved. In 1940, the New York Times voted Zanella the top Italian Restaurant in New York City. In 1985, The Chicago location opened and in 2002 the Los Angeles location opened. The Zanella restaurant has now been passed down 3 generations and the family is still passionate about the restaurant. </h3>
